## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added constructor function to `SetFontPath`
- Added new event, `Capture`, to support the new Doryen feature
- `example_runner` workspace package for running examples on the web using `trunk`

### Changed

- Update to Rust 2021 edition
- Update to Bevy 0.11.0
- Update to Doryen 1.3.0
- Move away from custom "render system" and instead use custom Bevy schedules to facilitate update vs render systems. I.e. most previous uses of `add_doryen_render_system(foo.system())` should be replaced with `add_systems(Render, foo)`. See the documentation for `MainRender` for more details.
- Cleaned up code from a few new lints
- Process `AppExit` events before others; no point doing anything else if we're about to quit
- Have the `swap_console` (internal implementation detail) ask for a 0,0 console instead of a 1,1 console, which avoids any associated allocations.
- Minor adjustment of documentation for `SetFontPath`
- Update `basic` example to match latest Doryen code
